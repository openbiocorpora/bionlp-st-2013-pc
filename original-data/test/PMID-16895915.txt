Nuclear export of S6K1 II is regulated by protein kinase CK2 phosphorylation at Ser-17. 
Ribosomal S6 kinases (S6Ks) are principal players in the regulation of cell growth and energy metabolism. Signaling via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin pathways mediates the activation of S6K in response to various mitogenic stimuli. The family of S6Ks consists of two forms, S6K1 and -2, that have cytoplasmic and nuclear splicing variants, S6K1 II and S6K1 I, respectively. Nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of both isoforms induced by mitogenic stimuli has been reported recently. Here we present the identification of protein kinase CK2 (CK2) as a novel binding and regulatory partner for S6K1 II. The interaction between S6K1 II and CK2beta regulatory subunit was initially identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen and further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of transiently expressed and endogenous proteins. The interaction between S6K1 II and CK2 was found to occur in serum-starved and serum-stimulated cells. In addition, we found that S6K1 II is a substrate for CK2. The localization of the CK2 phosphorylation site was narrowed down to Ser-17 in S6K1 II. Mutational analysis and the use of phosphospecific antibody indicate that Ser-17 is a major in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation site for CK2. Functional studies reveal that, in contrast to the wild type kinase, the phosphorylation-mimicking mutant of S6K1 II (S17E) retains its cytoplasmic localization in serum-stimulated cells. Treatment of cells with the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B revealed that the S17E mutant accumulates in the nucleus to the same extent as S6K1 II wild type. These results indicate that nuclear import of the S17E mutant is not affected, although the export is significantly enhanced. We also provide evidence that nuclear export of S6K1 is mediated by a CRM1-dependent mechanism. Taken together, this study establishes a functional link between S6K1 II and CK2 signaling, which involves the regulation of S6K1 II nuclear export by CK2-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-17.
