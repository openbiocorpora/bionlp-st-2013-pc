Regulation of the anaphase-promoting complex by the dual specificity phosphatase human Cdc14a. 
Two forms of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) mediate the degradation of critical cell cycle regulators. APC(Cdc20) promotes sister-chromatid separation by ubiquitinating securin, whereas APC(Cdh1) ubiquitinates mitotic cyclins, allowing the exit from mitosis. Here we show that phosphorylation of human Cdh1 (hCdh1) by cyclin B-Cdc2 alters the conformation of hCdh1 and prevents it from activating APC. A human homologue of yeast Cdc14, human Cdc14a (hCdc14a), dephosphorylates hCdh1 and activates APC(Cdh1). In contrast, hCdc14a does not affect the activity of APC(Cdc20). hCdc14a is a major phosphatase for hCdh1 and localizes to centrosomes in HeLa cells. Therefore, hCdc14a may promote the activation of APC(Cdh1) and exit from mitosis in mammalian cells.
